                <h3>Recipe for Ruin</h3>
                <p>Recipe For Ruin is a roguelike where cooked food is the primary form of combat. This game is currently in development as part of a 20 week project for Junior Workshop with an 18 person team and is expected to be finished in March 2025. I am the lead mechanics developer responsible for creating implementations of the game's combat system.</p>

                <h3>Ultimate</h3>
                <p>Ultimate is a bullet hell style game that I developed as part of the GMAP 260 Overview of Computer Gaming class at Drexel. This game was developed over 5 weeks by a team of 5 of which I was the lead Unity developer. A web playable version of this game is playable <a href="Ultimate/index.html">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>WacDonald's</h3>
                <p>WacDonald's is a top down 2D cooking game inspired by the gameplay of Overcooked and the spritework of the Pokemon franchise. This game was developed over 2 weeks by a team of 5 as part of Carnegie Mellon's National High School Game Academy program. I was responsible for designing and writing scripts in C# to implement the food cooking, bagging, and boost gameplay systems. After the program, my team and I decided to publish a version of this game to the MacOS App Store, available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/wacdonalds-cooking-simulator/id1528393418?mt=12">here</a>. A web playable version is available  <a href="WacDonald's/index.html">here</a>.</p>
